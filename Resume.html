        <p>
        I love working with people and helping others. I have experience with helping people by working as a <strong>CIT</strong>. I like to try new things that push myself. For example I joined karate and got my black belt and joined baseball when I was <em>very nervous</em>. I like building and creating thinks. Since I was little I loved putting things together if it was Legos or if it was an engineering project. I am a good leader and able to assist a group of people. I am hardworking and always do my best in any subject.

    This year I joined the chess club. I didn't know how to play very well, but I wanted to try something new. I play soccer and baseball for sports. In soccer I am a center defensmen and I encourage my team by doing a pump-up chant during half time. In baseball I am primarily a right fielder, and I try to help the freshman on my team get acclimated to High School baseball.
