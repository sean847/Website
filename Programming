   1. var x = 
 Makes a value for a variable <br>

2. x += 4;
Increases value to 4 <br>


3. for(var x =4; x is greater then 7; x++ ){       }
The max variable x can be is 7 <br>

4.
if( x == 0 ) {                         }

else {                                }

This is an if statement and when x = 0 then it does something different then if x is something else <br>
5. 
ellipse( ____, ___, ____, ___)

You can make a circle or oval by choosing where it is located on the x and y axis. Also by changing the size with the width and height. <br>
6. rect( ____, ____, ____, ____)

You can make a square or rectangle choosing where they are located with the x and y axis and how large they’ll be by changing its height and width. <br>
7. stroke ( ___, ___, ___)

fill ( ___, ___, ___)

The color of texts and the outline of text <br>
8. mouseX

mouseY

If you move your mouse with these functions you can make movement in code. <br>
9. draw=function(){              }

Can set the color and make shapes in this code as a function.

       Hardware
   </h2>
   <p>
   
1. Computer: A computer is an electronic device for storing and processing data. <br>
2. Inputs: A device that is put into the computer or puts something on the computer. <br>
3. Outputs: Something that sends data out of the computer. <br>

4. Motherboard: It holds, and allows communication between, many of the electronic components of a system, such as the central processing unit and memory, and provides connectors for other peripherals.<br>
5. CPU: CPU is the brains of the computer where most calculations take place. <br>
6. RAM: RAM is also called Random Access Memory, is the memory or information storage in a computer that is used to store running programs and data for the programs. <br>
7. Power Supply: The function of a power supply is to convert electric current from a source to the correct voltage.  <br>
8. Hard Disk Drive: the hard drive reads and writes data to the disk. The hard drive also transmits data back and forth between the CPU and the disk. <br> 
9. Solid State Drive: It supports reading and writing data and maintains stored data, SSDs, however, are faster, lighter, more durable, and use less energy compared to the HDD.

   <h3>
       Analog and Digital Data
   </h3>
   <p>
   Analog: Analog data is data that is represented in a physical way or is stored in physical media. Data is lost gradually. <br>                                               
   Digital: is information stored on a computer system as a series of 0's and 1's in a binary language. A small portion of the data is lost. <br>
   Encoded: analog signals are encoded by Amplitude Modulation, Frequency Modulation and Phase Modulation <br> 
   Encoded: It uses 0’s and 1’s to use the data. <br>
   Analog transmission is a method conveying information using a continuous signal which varies in amplitude.<br>
   Digital Data is transferred in the form of bits between two or more digital devices.

   </p>
   <h4>
       Binary and Algorithms
   </h4>
   <p> 
   Binary: Uses 1’s and 0’s only for numbers, the system used in computers. <br>
   Decimal: Uses 0-9, the number system we use mainly <br>
   Algorithm: to find what each number means in binary and decimal <br>
   Rules for Adding in Binary:

You start with zero and then add one, ex.

0 = 0 
1 = 1
10 = 2
11 = 3
100 = 4
101 = 5
110 = 6 <br>

   </p>
   <h5>
       The Web and HTML
   </h5>
   <p>
   HTML: It is markup language to show this document is going to be a website. <br>
   CSS: is where you type up the code <br>
   style>

You can add set colors to sections. 
<br>
h1 and h6
Different sections to add things possible different paragraphs or photos. 
<br>
strong uand emp:
To bold and emphasize your text. <br>
Storyboard: where you can see what you made in code<br>
OSI Model It is the model to explain the steps of sharing data <br>
div
It divides a section in your code
<br>

   </p>
   <h6>
       OSI Model Stages
   </h6>
   <p> </p>
   
physical:
Electromagnetic wave that carry the data <br>

Data link:
Your MAC address (prevents data collision); 16 digit hexadecimal code lanes the data travels through <br>

network:
Plans the route for data to travel; gives its IP (Internet Protocol) address prevent data collision/loss <br>

transportation:
Responsible for destroying viruses and blocks bad files; firewall <br>

session:
Writes down name and contents of packages; like a history; List of all files sent <br>

presentation:
Encrypts byte packages <br>

application:
Splits data into byte packages
