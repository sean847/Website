            <strong>More about me!</strong>
            
            <p>
            I have played soccer since kindagarden. In freshman <br> year I was put on JV2 but now as a sophomore I am now on JV. <br> For baseball I played in kindagarden and quit. Then in <br> seventh grade I decided to give baseball another try. My <br> freshman year I was on JV2 and this year there was no <br> season due to COVID-19 but I will play my Junior year. I started <br> doing karate in second grade. I later achieved my black <br> belt at the end of fifth grade. In latin in March there is a <br> national latin exam. In that exam I was rewarded the <br> highest metal Magum Cum Laede. I started playing piano in second <br> grade and haven't stoped yet. Bass I started because my <br> piano teacher told me about the importance of a bassist in a band. I <br> decided to start learning the bass and I have been playing <br> it for two years. I starting working as a CIT at the <br> Medfield summer camp last summer. I have done a lot of different<br> class (there is a table below with what classes I took each <br> year). My cat's name is Teddy and he is eleven. My Dog's<br> name is Duffy and he his is seven.
