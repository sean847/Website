        I love working with people and helping others. I have experience with helping people by <br>
        working as a <strong>CIT</strong>. I like to try new things that push myself. For example I joined karate <br> and got my black belt and joined baseball when I was <em>very nervous</em>. I like building and <br> creating thinks. Since I was little I loved putting things together if it was Legos or if it was <br> an engineering project. I am a good leader and able to assist a group of people. I am <br>  hardworking and always do my best in any subject.

    This year I joined the chess club. I didn't know how to play very well, but I wanted to try <br> something new. I play soccer and baseball for sports. In soccer I am a center defensmen <br> and I encourage my team by doing a pump-up chant during half time. In baseball I am <br> primarily a right fielder, and I try to help the freshman on my team get acclimated to High <br> School baseball.
